### Clean Installation (Recommended for Updates)

When updating to a new version of the application, it is highly recommended to perform a clean installation to ensure that no residual files or outdated configurations interfere with the new update.

To completely remove the previous installation, we recommend using **Revo Uninstaller**.

1.  **Download:** Get [Revo Uninstaller Free](https://www.revouninstaller.com/products/revo-uninstaller-free/) and install it on your system.
2.  **Uninstall:** Open Revo Uninstaller, locate our application, and click **Uninstall**.
3.  **Scan for Leftovers:** Use the "Moderate" or "Advanced" scan feature to find and remove remaining files, folders, and registry entries.
4.  **Install New Version:** Once clean, download and install the latest release.
