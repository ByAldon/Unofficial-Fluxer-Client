### Clean Installation Guide

When updating to FluxCap 1.4.9, we highly recommend performing a clean installation to prevent old cache files or outdated configurations from causing unexpected behavior [cite: 2026-02-22].

1.  **Uninstall:** Use a tool like **Revo Uninstaller** to remove the previous "Unofficial Fluxer Client" [cite: 2026-02-22].
2.  **Scan for Leftovers:** Ensure remaining files in `%AppData%\unofficial-fluxer-client` are removed [cite: 2026-02-22].
3.  **Install the New Update:** Download and install the latest FluxCap release [cite: 2026-02-22].

## 💻 Usage

Simply launch **FluxCap** from your start menu or desktop shortcut [cite: 2026-02-22]. The client will automatically connect to the Fluxer web interface [cite: 2026-02-22].

If you close the window, FluxCap will silently minimize to your system tray to keep you connected in the background [cite: 2026-02-22]. Right-click the tray icon to completely quit the application, clear the cache, or manually check for updates [cite: 2026-02-22].
